So much of his show was about pointing at people and finding clips to show that person saying one thing but doing another, and hypocrisy here there and everywhere.</p><p>It made you cynical. Over time, the show became extremely cynical. And cynicism leads to apathy, something the show&rsquo;s main demographic&mdash;our generation&mdash;already has in abundance.</p><p>Jon Stewart&rsquo;s message was, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have reasonable discourse, instead of polarizing everything and making everything an us vs. them dick measuring contest.&rdquo; This message was so amazing, but I guess nobody was listening.  As for how the show evolved over time, the problem for wasn&rsquo;t the content of the narrative, it&rsquo;s the framing of the narrative. Everything is bullshit. Those with power/wealth are all hypocrites. Look at all these retarded people running our country.</p><p>Us vs. them. Everything has to be divided into sides. Are you team Jacob or team Edward? You&rsquo;ll never win, because you&rsquo;re choosing one of two myths.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you choose team Edward because you believe in sparkles. Anyone who chooses to be a werewolf is anti-sparkle and is therefore retarded. And then you find out that team Jacob has a bunch of supporters. OH MY GOD HOW CAN THEY BELIEVE IN JACOB BULLSHIT? That just fills you up with outrage. So much bickering.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s consider it from a perspective that&rsquo;s not yours. Say you&rsquo;re a mommy who chooses not to vaccinated your kids. You know big Pharma is evil and medical research doesn&rsquo;t exactly have a stellar track record (see: Tuskegee). Then you meet people who support vaccines. They say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a stupid idiot and you&rsquo;re threatening all of society and everyone hates you!&lrquo; Do you honestly think that kind of persuasion is going to change your mind? Probably not, because nobody likes being yelled at.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the problem I have with Daily Show. All that yelling, even if the yelling was sandwiched in witty jokes.</p><p>I think Jon Stewart was at his best when he called people out&mdash;to their faces&mdash;for their errors. The most notable being that time he went on Crossfire and called Paul Begala and Tucker Carlson, &ldquo;political hacks.&rdquo; Or, in the <a rhef=\"http://thedailyshow.cc.com/video-playlists/srkt02/daily-show-14036/iinzrx\">Jim Cramer beatdown.</a> In other words, I think he is best at what he does when he&rsquo;s actually being serious.</p>",

When a source sends data to a destination, the file is sent in a series of packets. When the destination receives each packet it sends an acknowledgement back to the source.
