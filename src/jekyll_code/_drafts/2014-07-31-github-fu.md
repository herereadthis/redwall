Go beyond simple GitHub commits and pull request and take advantage of powerful capabilities to increase collaboration and productivity.

* Control submodules, subtrees, branching workflows and rebasing
* Use terminal commands to reveal more information about your repo
* Customize your configuration, attributes, and hooks

### Best practices

#### Branches are cheap, make lots of them.

It doesn't take a lot of effort to create new branches (all you create is a checksum). Don't get attached to your branch. If you're working with a team create a new branch every time you take on a new task (and name it after the ticket or task), merge back to master as soon as you can, and destroy that branch.

----------------

### Use Terminal commands to learn more about your repo

#### Basic Git commands



{% highlight bash %}
# If you made a commit and forgot some file in the commit
$ git commit -m "commit message"
$ git add forgotten_file
$ git commit --amend
# If you want to unstage a file you accidentally added
$ git reset HEAD FILENAME
# Discard the changes you've staged
$ git checkout -- FILENAME
{% endhighlight %}

#### Rediculous Git commands

{% highlight bash %}
# review the commit history of your repo
$ git log --pretty=format:"%h | %an | %s" --graph
{% endhighlight %}
