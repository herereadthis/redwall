Redwall is the codebase of the website, "Here, Read This" at [herereadthis.com](http://herereadthis.com), and is created by [Jimmy Ha](https://github.com/herereadthis). The homepage is a tribute to 90s web design, while additional pages feature coding projects and photographic works.

A new rewrite of Redwall is underway, with React. The architecture will use:

* React
* Flux w/ Flummox
* ImmutableJS
* Webpack
* Babel
* LESS
